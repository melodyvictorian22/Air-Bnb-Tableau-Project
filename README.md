# Air-Bnb Dashboard
This is a dashboard that I make in Tableau using dataset Air Bnb Seattle 2016 that I took from Alex Freberg on Youtube to complete Data Analyst Bootcamp.

Link Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset

Before jump in into making a dashboard, make sure to correct joins between sheets base on listingsId in Listings Sheet and Calendar Sheet.
